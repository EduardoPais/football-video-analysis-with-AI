Football Video Analysis with AI

This project is an experimental tool to analyze football (soccer) matches from a top-down video recording using computer vision and machine learning.

The main objective is to detect players and the ball, track them over time, and generate useful match statistics such as possession, player movement heatmaps, and passing patterns.

It is primarily a learning project to explore neural networks, object detection, tracking, and image analysis, while gradually building toward a working prototype.

Roadmap
Phase 1: Setup and Basics

 Learn the fundamentals of neural networks and convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

 Explore object detection frameworks such as YOLOv8 or Detectron2.

 Load and preprocess football match video data with OpenCV.

Phase 2: Player and Ball Detection

 Implement object detection to identify players and the ball.

 Train or fine-tune a model on football-specific datasets (e.g., SoccerNet).

 Visualize detections with bounding boxes on video frames.

Phase 3: Tracking

 Integrate a multi-object tracker (e.g., DeepSORT, ByteTrack, SORT).

 Assign consistent IDs to players across frames.

 Track ball movement over time.

Phase 4: Field Mapping

 Apply homography to map video coordinates to field coordinates.

 Normalize player positions for tactical analysis.

 Visualize positions on a 2D pitch diagram.

Phase 5: Statistics and Visualization

 Generate heatmaps of player positions.

 Estimate ball possession per team.

 Count passes and detect basic events (e.g., shots, goals).

Phase 6: Advanced Features (Future Work)

 Formation recognition.

 Automatic event classification (fouls, corners, offsides).

 Live analysis from streaming video.

Tech Stack

Python

PyTorch or TensorFlow for deep learning

OpenCV for video processing and visualization

YOLOv8 or Detectron2 for object detection

DeepSORT or ByteTrack for tracking

Goal

The aim of this project is not to create a professional-grade analytics system, but to build a functional prototype that combines modern AI and computer vision techniques to analyze football matches.
